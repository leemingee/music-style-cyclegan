As I just realized that other researchers have implemented this idea and his network architecture is really nice. Based on my current knowledge, I can't use CycleGAN better for this thesis.

Refer to the [paper](https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/2e6c8407bf92ce1e47c0faa7e9a3014d/cyclegan-music-style%20(3).pdf) and [Github repo](https://github.com/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer)

We both refer to the tf implementation of CycleGan by Xiaowei Hu, who did a excellent work. [Github repo](https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow)

So I will stop here, try to explore more and will be back.

There must exist other solutions of the music genre transfer and more work can be done here, based on my literature review.
