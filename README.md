And I just realized that other researchers have implemented this idea and his network architecture is really nice. 

Refer to the [paper](https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/2e6c8407bf92ce1e47c0faa7e9a3014d/cyclegan-music-style%20(3).pdf) and [Github repo](https://github.com/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer)

We both refer to the tf implementation of CycleGan by Xiaowei Hu, who did a excellent work. [Github repo](https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow)

So I will stop here, try to explore more and will be back.
