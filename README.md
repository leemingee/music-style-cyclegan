# music-style-cyclegan
Music Style Transfer based on CycleGan.

Project launched on 10/12/2018, as the final project for COMSW4995_006 Applied Deep Learning under the supervision of Prof. Joshua Gordon.

As I just realized that other researchers have implemented this idea and his network architecture is really nice. Based on my current knowledge, I may try other preprocessing way, remodify the network or change the evaluation way to continue to contribute more new ideas. As I was buried with the Job hunting things, I may come back later.

Refer to the [paper](https://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/file/2e6c8407bf92ce1e47c0faa7e9a3014d/cyclegan-music-style%20(3).pdf) and [Github repo](https://github.com/sumuzhao/CycleGAN-Music-Style-Transfer)

We both refer to the tf implementation of CycleGan by Xiaowei Hu, who did a decent, clean, excellent work. [Github repo](https://github.com/xhujoy/CycleGAN-tensorflow)
